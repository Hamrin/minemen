This will copy down all of the files, organize them appropriately and init a fresh new git repository within which you can build your next big thing.


To run the MineMen app:

		node server.js

In case of you encounter error regarding socket.io run the below command within the minemen directory:

        npm install socket.io

If successfully able to run the server you will get the port number. i.e: 5000

Go to :
