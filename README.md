To start a project:
        
    git clone https://github.com/Hamrin/minemen.git
    cd minemen

This will copy down all of the files, organize them appropriately and init a fresh new git repository within which you can build your next big thing.

Install required dependencies (express and socket.io):

    cd minemen
    npm install

To run the MineMen app:

    node server.js

If successfully able to run the server you will get the port number. i.e: 8081

Go to :

    http://localhost:8081

and you will see the GUI for the game.
